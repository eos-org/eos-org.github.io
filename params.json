It's also designed to be a place to learn about PHP extension writing \"the right way\" since best practices are generally copy and paste 10 year old code nastiness.\r\n\r\n### Get Involved\r\n\r\nStarting the beginning of this year auroraeosrose (and hopefully others) will be running a mentoring program for people wishing to adopt, create, or maintain PHP extensions.  If you'd like to get involved send a message to auroraeosrose@gmail.com with \"2016 Extension Mentoring\" in the subject.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
